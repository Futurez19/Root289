Hello Everyone!

This read me is to set up some ground rules about GitHub/Kraken. Although we should already know, I'm going to write it down here.

1. Have your own branch! This helps with keeping messy code out of our Main (Master) Code.
2. Remember to update Local Master before Merging your code / Pushing Local Master to the Origin
3. Remember to notify the group if you are Pushing Local Master to Origin! We don't want anyones files to be overwritten.

Steps to Updating the Origin's Master

There are two Ways to do this: 

"Master to Master" Aka "Direct"

or 

"Branch to Master" Aka "Request"

(Yes, these are their names, because I said so.)

"Direct"
Direct method is the easiest way to update Origin master, simply push from your Local Master and it will update the Origin Master.

    - Note:
    - Potentially dangerous if you forgot to pull or you are pushing at the same time as someone else.
    - Although GitKraken should warn you that you are pushing an non-updated build however, it takes a while for your GitKraken to notice someone elses push.
    - To be safe, please notify the group when you are pushing into Master to prevent any possible problems.

How to use "Direct" Method.
