Hello Everyone!

This read me is to set up some ground rules about GitHub/Kraken. Although we should already know, I'm going to write it down here.

1. Have your own branch! This helps with keeping messy code out of our Main (Master) Code.
2. Remember to update Local Master before Merging your code / Pushing Local Master to the Origin
3. Remember to notify the group if you are Pushing Local Master to Origin! We don't want anyones files to be overwritten.
4. Merges are done by clicking and dragging your repos into other repos. (Ex: Dragging your local branch into your local Master)

Steps to Updating the Origin's Master

There are two Ways to do this: 

    "Master to Master" Aka "Direct"

or 

    "Branch to Master" Aka "Request"

(Yes, these are their names, because I said so.)

"Direct"

Direct method is the easiest way to update Origin master, simply push from your Local Master and it will update the Origin Master.
    - 
    - Note:
    - Potentially dangerous if you forgot to pull or you are pushing at the same time as someone else.
    - Although GitKraken should warn you that you are pushing an non-updated build however, it takes a while for your GitKraken to notice someone elses push.
    - To be safe, please notify the group when you are pushing into Master to prevent any possible problems.

How to use "Direct" Method.
(Ignore the first two steps if you are already updated.)

1. Pull from your local master to update it.
2. Merge local branch into local master. (This should now update files with the same name, and add any newly created files)
3. Notify the group that you are pushing to Origin
4. If all seems clear -> Push to Origin.

"Request"

You request to push into Origin Master from your Branch, only the Repo-Guy (Anthony) can allow it through. Albeit a bit safer, if Repo-Man is offline, you'll have to wait till they see the request.
-
- We should only really have to use this if we're bugfixing or trying to tentatively insert a bunch of things.

How to use "Request" Method

1. Push your changes from your Local Branch to Origin Branch (You could attempt to push directly to Origin Master but I think it's cleaner to just easy push to Branch)
2. Now drag your Origin Branch onto the Origin Master, This should cause a request call.
3. Await for the push to be accepted.
4. Pull from Local Master to update your Local Master.

This is just what conventions I find to work, this can change if we find a better way of doing thins. That's all.
